### ðŸš€STRATEC ROCKET CHALLENGEðŸš€

<b>ok, this was amazing</b> , so cosidering I didn't make it 'till Monday I wanted to go a little extra (astronomical) mile, feeling I had to

#### running it:
```bash
#yes, twice
cd soft_challange/soft_challange
```

so `pwd` returns somehting like `/path/to/soft_challange/soft_challange`
then

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
flask --app . run
```
and now you can access the app through your localhost or 127.000 or whatever

In the homepage you can drag and drop files for each stage of the problem (don't judge okay, I know it looks goofy)

##### The simplest way to use it is to just upload planetary data (computes stage 1)

#### Then you can also upload rocket data (computes stage 2)

#### Now the fun, does indeed begin. This is the output for uploading all three, planetary, rocket *and* solar system data

##### And just below are the options for all other stages:

#### I'll start with the last one: the angular positions of the planets after 365 days passing from them being aligned

obviously, earth is aligned again

Now, sparing you the details of stage 3, these are 5 and 6:

Depending on whichever is fitting, those planetts will either:

- be stationary showing the day in which we do our travel (for stage 5)
- or a `gif` will be generated showing how planets and the rocket are moving <b>during</b> our travel (for stage 6)

respectively

Followed by (as requested) the angular positions on the start [and end for stage 6]  days.

Here is also a really cool graph I used during my solution (completely unrelated, took me 2 hours to realise it doesn't even help me)

ok ye im sorry if it's a little too extra but i really just wanted an interview =))
